# Installation

Lightrail depends on bridge extensions to interact with other software on your machine. To use the built-in VSCode and Chrome integrations, the VSCode and Chrome extensions must be installed separately.

1. **Download & install the appropriate Lightrail Core package for your operating system:**
   - OS X: [lightrail-core.dmg](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-core.dmg)
   - Ubuntu: [lightrail-core.deb](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-core.deb)
   - Fedora: [lightrail-core.rpm](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-core.rpm)
2. **Install the VSCode Extension:**
   1. Install this extension in VSCode: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightrail.lightrail-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightrail.lightrail-vscode)
      - To do this, press âŒ˜/ctrl-p to open the VSCode Quick Open UI, then paste in the following command and hit Enter/Return: `ext install lightrail.lightrail-vscode`
3. **Install the Chrome Extension:**
   1. Download this file: [lightrail-chrome.zip](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-chrome.zip)
   2. Unzip `lightrail-chrome.zip`. It should contain a folder called `dist`.
   3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`. There should be a toggle in the upper-right labelled `Developer Mode`. Toggle it so that `Developer Mode` is enabled.
   4. Click the `Load unpacked` button, and select the `dist` folder (from step 2).
   5. Done! For more details / pictures, see: [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
